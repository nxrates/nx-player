## Summary

This paper provides a comparative evaluation of modern onset detection algorithms, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses across different music genres and use cases. It validates the approach of using multiple methods and combining their results.

## Key Contributions

1. **Comparative Evaluation**:
   - Systematic comparison of multiple onset detection methods
   - Performance metrics across different genres
   - Identification of method-specific strengths

2. **Multi-Method Validation**:
   - Demonstrates that no single method is best for all cases
   - Supports consensus voting strategy
   - Provides evidence for genre-specific method selection

3. **Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Accuracy metrics for different methods
   - Genre-specific performance analysis
   - Computational complexity considerations

## Relevance to Stratum DSP

This paper validates our multi-method consensus approach:

### Consensus Voting Strategy
- **Finding**: Different methods excel in different scenarios
- **Implementation**: We combine Energy Flux, Spectral Flux, HFC, and HPSS
- **Benefit**: Improved robustness across diverse music genres

### Performance Expectations
- Provides benchmarks we can compare against
- Sets realistic accuracy expectations (70-90% recall depending on genre)
- Identifies edge cases where methods fail

### Method Selection
- Energy Flux: Best for clean electronic music
- Spectral Flux: Best for compressed/processed audio
- HFC: Best for percussive content
- HPSS: Best for complex/mixed material

## Key Findings

### Method Performance by Genre

**Electronic/Dance Music**:
- Energy Flux: 85-90% recall
- Spectral Flux: 80-85% recall
- HFC: 90-95% recall (excellent for drums)

**Rock/Pop Music**:
- Energy Flux: 70-75% recall
- Spectral Flux: 75-80% recall
- HFC: 80-85% recall

**Classical Music**:
- Energy Flux: 60-70% recall (soft attacks)
- Spectral Flux: 70-75% recall
- HFC: 65-70% recall

**Jazz/Complex Music**:
- All methods: 60-75% recall (polyphonic challenges)
- Consensus voting: 75-80% recall (improvement)

### Computational Complexity

- **Energy Flux**: O(n) - fastest
- **Spectral Flux**: O(n log n) - moderate
- **HFC**: O(n log n) - moderate
- **HPSS**: O(n log n) - moderate (most expensive)

## Implementation Implications

### Consensus Voting
- **Tolerance Window**: 50ms recommended (matches our implementation)
- **Weighting**: Equal weights work well, but confidence-based weighting improves results
- **Agreement Threshold**: 2+ methods agreeing → high confidence

### Parameter Tuning
- Genre-specific parameters can improve accuracy
- Adaptive thresholds outperform fixed thresholds
- Frame size and hop size trade-offs discussed

## Performance Benchmarks

### Overall Accuracy
- **Best Single Method**: 75-85% recall (genre-dependent)
- **Consensus Voting**: 80-90% recall (improvement)
- **Precision**: 70-85% (depends on threshold tuning)

### Computational Performance
- **Energy Flux**: <1ms per 30s track
- **Spectral Flux**: 5-10ms per 30s track
- **HFC**: 5-10ms per 30s track
- **HPSS**: 20-30ms per 30s track
- **Total (all methods)**: 30-50ms per 30s track

## Edge Cases Identified

1. **Soft Attacks**: Energy methods miss soft onsets (piano, strings)
2. **Rapid Successions**: Methods may merge closely spaced onsets
3. **Noise**: All methods degrade with high noise levels
4. **Reverberation**: Phase-based methods help but are complex
5. **Polyphonic Complexity**: Multiple simultaneous onsets challenge all methods

## Recommendations

1. **Use Multiple Methods**: Consensus voting improves robustness
2. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Better than fixed thresholds
3. **Genre Awareness**: Tune parameters per genre if possible
4. **Post-Processing**: Merge closely spaced onsets, filter false positives
