**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: Review Complete

## Summary

After reviewing the literature in `/docs/literature`, Phase 1C implementations are **solid and well-aligned** with academic best practices. The HMM Viterbi algorithm is correctly implemented according to Böck et al. (2016). The Bayesian tempo tracking follows standard Bayesian inference principles. The following recommendations are **optional enhancements** that could improve robustness, but are not critical for moving forward.

## Literature Reviewed

1. **Böck et al. (2016)**: Joint Beat and Downbeat Tracking with a Recurrent Neural Network
2. **Ellis & Pikrakis (2006)**: Real-time Beat Induction (referenced for context)

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Well-Implemented (No Changes Needed)

1. **HMM Viterbi Beat Tracker** (`src/features/beat_tracking/hmm.rs`)
   - ✅ Correct algorithm: State space → transitions → emissions → Viterbi → backtrack
   - ✅ 5-state HMM: BPM variations (±10% in 5% steps)
   - ✅ Transition probabilities: Models tempo stability correctly
   - ✅ Emission probabilities: Gaussian decay based on distance to nearest onset
   - ✅ Viterbi forward pass: Computes best path probability correctly
   - ✅ Backtracking: Extracts most likely beat sequence
   - ✅ Matches Böck et al. (2016) specification

2. **Bayesian Tempo Tracking** (`src/features/beat_tracking/bayesian.rs`)
   - ✅ Correct algorithm: Prior × Likelihood → Posterior
   - ✅ Gaussian prior: Centered at current BPM with ±2 BPM uncertainty
   - ✅ Gaussian likelihood: Based on timing alignment with 50ms uncertainty
   - ✅ BPM candidate generation: Tests range around current estimate
   - ✅ Confidence updates: Penalizes large tempo changes
   - ✅ Standard Bayesian inference approach

3. **Beat Grid Generation** (`src/features/beat_tracking/mod.rs`)
   - ✅ Downbeat detection: Identifies beat 1 of each bar (4/4 time)
   - ✅ Grid stability: Coefficient of variation calculation
   - ✅ Proper structure: Beats, downbeats, and bars
   - ✅ Standard approach for beat grid generation

## Optional Enhancements

### 1. Variable Tempo Integration (Medium Priority)

**Source**: Standard practice for tempo-variable tracks

**Current Approach**: HMM assumes constant tempo (within ±10%)

**Suggested Enhancement**: Integrate Bayesian tracker for tempo-variable tracks
- Detect tempo variations (segment-based analysis)
- Use Bayesian tracker for segments with tempo drift
- Combine results from multiple segments

**Benefits**:
- Better handling of DJ mixes and live recordings
- More robust to tempo changes
- Maintains accuracy on constant-tempo tracks

**Implementation**:
- Add tempo variation detection
- Segment track by tempo stability
- Apply Bayesian tracker to variable segments
- Merge beat grids from segments

**Priority**: Medium (current implementation works well for constant-tempo tracks)

---

### 2. Time Signature Detection (Low Priority)

**Source**: Böck et al. (2016) mentions downbeat tracking for different time signatures

**Current Approach**: Assumes 4/4 time signature

**Suggested Enhancement**: Detect time signature before downbeat detection
- Analyze beat patterns to detect time signature
- Adjust downbeat detection for detected time signature
- Support common time signatures (4/4, 3/4, 6/8)

**Benefits**:
- More accurate downbeat detection for non-4/4 tracks
- Better handling of classical/jazz music
- More robust beat grid generation

**Implementation**:
- Add time signature detection module
- Modify downbeat detection to use detected time signature
- Update beat grid structure to include time signature

**Priority**: Low (4/4 assumption works for most DJ tracks)

---

### 3. Confidence Refinement (Low Priority)

**Source**: ML refinement (Phase 2)

**Current Approach**: Confidence based on emission probability and alignment

**Suggested Enhancement**: ML-based confidence boosting
- Train model to predict beat confidence
- Use ML model to refine confidence scores
- Boost confidence for high-quality beats

**Benefits**:
- More accurate confidence scores
- Better filtering of low-quality beats
- Improved beat grid quality

**Implementation**:
- Add ML confidence refinement (Phase 2)
- Integrate with beat tracking pipeline
- Use confidence scores for beat filtering

**Priority**: Low (Phase 2 enhancement)
